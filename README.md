## Breakout Clone
I wanted a project to learn C and the SDL framework in, and settled upon this game as I thought it was a simple and approachable project for me to execute.

### TODO:
- make a better input system (one that doesn't crash the game)
- make the bricks (make sure they've got some space up top)
- make the bouncer collisions more reliable
- make beeping sound effects
